## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df =
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read precipitation data\! for 2018 and 2017.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation.

``` r
month_df =
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df =
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

precip_df =
  left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data. In
this dataset:

  - The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8
  - The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

Read the NY Transit dataset.

``` r
subway_df = 
    read_csv(
      "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>%
    mutate(
      entry = case_when(entry == "YES" ~ "TRUE", entry == "NO" ~ "FALSE"),
      entry = as.logical(entry)
    )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset comes from NY Transit, with information on line, station,
name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending,
entrance type, and ADA compliance.

To clean the data, I first recoded the variable names into snake case,
and then converted the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a
logical variable (TRUE vs FALSE).

The cleaned dataset has 1868 rows and 19 columns. The dataset is not
very tidy (e.g. route1-11 should be collapsed into one column).

  - There are 465 distinct stations.
  - 84 stations are ADA compliant.
  - 0.3770492 of station entrances / exits without vending allow
    entrance.

Reformat data to make route number and route name distinct variables.

``` r
subway_tidy = 
  subway_df %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(route8:route11), as.character) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route_name"
  ) %>% 
  drop_na(route_name)
```

  - There are 60 distinct stations that serve the A train.
  - Of the stations that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 3

Read and clean the pols-month dataset.

``` r
pols_df = 
  read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>%
  mutate(
    month = month.abb[as.factor(month)],
    president = case_when(prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop", prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem")
  ) %>% 
  select(-c(prez_dem, prez_gop, day))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

Read and clean the snp dataset.

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("./data/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>%
  select(year, month, close)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

Read and clean the unemployment dataset.

``` r
unemployment_df = 
  read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "Month",
    values_to = "unemp_pct"
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

Join the three datasets.

``` r
join_df = 
  left_join(pols_df, snp_df, by = c("year", "month")) %>% 
  left_join(unemployment_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The three datasets are from a post called Science Isn’t Broken from the
FiveThirtyEight website founded by Nate Silver. They serve as part of
the interactive tool where the reader can select the political party of
interest and then can make a series of choices about both types and
forms of variables to consider in the search for a significant
association between political party and economic success.

For data import and manipulation, I broke the date variable into year
and month variables for merging purposes in dataset pols-month and snp.
